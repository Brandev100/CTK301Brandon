  <p class="about_me">Created for the ISU Game Dev Club 2024 winter game jam. Made in Game Maker. All programming was done by me over the course of 7 days. Players align relics into an otherworldly machine to summon and power up their monster in order to defeat the evil raiders. The game features multiple enemies, 8 power ups, and an adjacent rune buffing mechanic. Art by Joseph Wittrock, music by Bob Skudnig, and sound design by me.</p>
