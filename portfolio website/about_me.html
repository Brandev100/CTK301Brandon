  <p class="about_me">My name is Brandon Byers. I grew up loving games and as a result loved to develop them. My specialty is programming. I've coded for games made in Unreal Engine 5, Unity, Game Maker, and Pico 8. I am knowledgeable in languages such as C++, C#, Python, Java Script, and Lua. I have also studied extensive amounts of game design. I have written TDDs, GDDs, and ran multiple teams in game development through various agile methodologies such as Kanban and Sprint. I am currently based in Normal IL but can travel or move for work.</p>
