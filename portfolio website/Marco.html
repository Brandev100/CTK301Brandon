  <p class="about_me">Created for College of Dupage Capstone 2024. Made in Unreal Engine 5. Character programming, player water physics, power ups, sfx programming, sanity effects programming, and overall game feel adjustments coded by me. Made with a team of four people total. Was done by me over the course of one semester. Players play as Pollo, a person looking for their brother Marco. They venture into twisted pool rooms in search of their brother while trying to avoid dangerous monsters.</p>
