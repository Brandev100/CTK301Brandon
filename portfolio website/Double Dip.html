  <p class="about_me">Created for the ISU Game Dev Club 2024 summer game jam. Made in Game Maker. All programming and art was done by me over the course of 5 days. Players choose between three ice cream characters to play as in order to gun down hordes of evil ice cream enemies. This game features multiple enemies, three playable characters, and a buff/de-buff system. Double Dip on buffs but at the cost of double the nerfs.</p>
